The best way to compile and run my code would be to use an IDE such as intellij,
but you can also just download my MyGrid class and compile it by
typing on your keyboard, "javac MyGrid.java" and running by typing "java MyGrid"
You will also need the other classes like cell, and stackGen if you don't have them

Assumptions:
You must have something that can run a java program

I certify that the information contained in this README
file is complete and accurate. I have both read and followed the course policies
in the ’Academic Integrity - Course Policy’ section of the course syllabus.
